# Health Expenditure vs Preventable Disease
# 1. Introduction and Motivation
Health conditions vary significantly between countries due to differences in economic development and healthcare infrastructure. In this project, we investigate whether there is a measurable relationship between national health expenditure and the number of reported cases for two vaccine-preventable diseases: measles and diphtheria. The analysis focuses on data from 2000 to 2019, covering a wide range of countries with different income levels and regions.

# 2. Data Sources
## World Health Organization (WHO)
Offers broad data about diseases, death rates, and vaccine coverage. It helps highlight which health issues appear in different regions.
## World Bank Open Data
Lists numbers like GDP per person, reading and writing rates, and other social factors. This allows comparing nations at different wealth levels.

# 3. Approach
## Collecting and Cleaning Data
- Bring together info on illnesses, death numbers, and health expenditure
- Align each country or region’s name across data sets, handle any missing or odd values.
- Exploratory Work
- Create scatter plots, bar charts, or maps to see potential relationships between health and social indicators.
- Apply hypothesis testing to see if differences among countries mean something or might be random.

## Modeling
- Classification: If labeling countries (e.g., “high risk” vs. “low risk”), a classification model fits.
- Check performance with metrics such as R-squared, accuracy, and cross-validation to ensure stable results.

## Ethical and Practical Factors
- Data is mostly on a country level, lowering privacy risks.
- Cite original sources properly and follow license requirements.

# 4. Expected Results
- Main Factors: Identify which economic or social measurements (e.g., average income, public health spending) link most with better or worse outcomes in preventable disease incidences.
- Charts: Offer visuals that display regional differences and highlight patterns in disease or healthcare.

# 5. Limits and Future Work
- Data Differences: Various providers measure or define health terms differently, which might cause confusion.
- Gaps in Coverage: Some regions may only have partial or outdated statistics.
- Further Analysis: Future work could examine how these factors change over time or break them down by regions.
# 6. Schedule
- By March 10: Finalize the project scope and upload an initial proposal on GitHub (README).
- By April 25: Collect data, clean it, and do early analysis.
- By May 23: Build and test the models, compare outcomes, and refine the steps.
- By May 30: Complete the final report and share all code and documentation on GitHub.
# Conclusion
This project studies how health expenditure among different countries relate to preventable diseases on a global level, pulling data from several well-known sources. The findings could help guide steps to reduce health gaps and encourage better living conditions for populations in many parts of the world.
