# Global-Health-Project
# 1. Introduction and Motivation
Health results can differ a lot across different parts of the world, influenced by healthcare quality and economic factors. By looking at it on a wider scale, it’s possible to see if issues like chronic illnesses or vaccine coverage connect strongly with things like average income, school enrollment, or spending on medical services. Using data from a few major organizations, this project tries to see patterns that might lead to better planning and resource use for healthcare around the world.

# 2. Data Sources
## World Health Organization (WHO)
Offers broad data about diseases, death rates, and vaccine coverage. It helps highlight which health issues appear in different regions.
## World Bank Open Data
Lists numbers like GDP per person, reading and writing rates, and other social factors. This allows comparing nations at different wealth levels.

## Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)
Provides info on disease rates, risk factors, and healthcare performance across many countries.

## UN Data
Gathers data from multiple UN agencies, covering economic, population, and development metrics.

## Our World in Data
Contains interactive charts and downloadable sets about health, environment, and social growth worldwide.

# 3. Approach
## Collecting and Cleaning Data
- Bring together info on illnesses, death numbers, and socioeconomic factors (GDP per person, education levels, etc.).
- Align each country or region’s name across data sets, handle any missing or odd values.
- Exploratory Work
- Create scatter plots, bar charts, or maps to see potential relationships between health and social indicators.
- Apply simple stats tests (like t-tests) to see if differences among countries mean something or might be random.

## Modeling
Regression: If aiming to predict a number (like life expectancy), a basic linear or nonlinear model could be used.
- Classification: If labeling countries (e.g., “high risk” vs. “low risk”), a classification model fits.
- Check performance with metrics such as R-squared, accuracy, and cross-validation to ensure stable results.

## Ethical and Practical Factors
- Data is mostly on a country level, lowering privacy risks.
- Cite original sources properly and follow license requirements.

# 4. Expected Results
- Main Factors: Identify which economic or social measurements (e.g., average income, public health spending) link most with better or worse health conditions.
- Maps and Charts: Offer visuals that display regional differences and highlight patterns in disease or healthcare.
- Policy Tips: Suggest ways for governments and global bodies to use these insights to help certain populations or invest resources more effectively.

# 5. Limits and Future Work
- Data Differences: Various providers measure or define health terms differently, which might cause confusion.
- Gaps in Coverage: Some regions may only have partial or outdated statistics.
- Further Analysis: Future work could examine how these factors change over time or break them down by age groups or genders.
# 6. Schedule
- By March 10: Finalize the project scope and upload an initial proposal on GitHub (README).
- By April 18: Collect data, clean it, and do early analysis.
- By May 23: Build and test the models, compare outcomes, and refine the steps.
- By May 30: Complete the final report and share all code and documentation on GitHub.
# Conclusion
This project studies how different social and economic indicators relate to health patterns on a global level, pulling data from several well-known sources. The findings could help guide steps to reduce health gaps and encourage better living conditions for populations in many parts of the world.
